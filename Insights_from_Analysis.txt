    II. From Statistical Analysis, we conclude "Top Factors Contributing to Churn" are:

        1. Correlation Analysis
        The features most correlated with churn (positive correlation) are:
            - Age: 0.285 (strongest correlation)
            - GeographyID: 0.154
            - Balance: 0.119
            - GenderID: 0.107
            - IsActiveMember: -0.156 (negative correlation, indicating active members are less likely to churn)

        2. Decision Tree Feature Importance
        The decision tree model identifies the following as the top predictors of churn:
            - Age: 21.4% importance (most significant factor)
